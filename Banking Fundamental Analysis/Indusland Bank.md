## Good-to-know

- "Usually, [loans] should not be higher than 70% of total assets, consistent with IndusInd Bank’s case with a ratio of 65%. At this level of loan, the bank has preserved a sensible level between maintaining liquidity and generating interest income from the loan."

-"This mismatch between illiquid loans and liquid deposits poses a risk for the bank if unusual events occur and requires it to immediately repay its depositors. Relative to the prudent industry loan to deposit level of 90%, IndusInd Bank’s ratio of over 96% is higher, which positions the bank in a risky spot given the potential to cross into negative liquidity disparity between loan and deposit levels. Basically, for ₹1 of deposits with the bank, it lends out over ₹0.9 which is imprudent."
